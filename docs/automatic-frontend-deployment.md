# Automatic public frontend deployment

On GitHub, `Mirror CI` runs the full repository verification and builds the
deployable frontend image on every pull request branch. Those builds receive no
registry or deployment credentials. Pushes to main and manual dispatches of main
run the `Deploy` workflow: it builds the image, publishes it to GitHub Packages,
joins the tailnet and streams the same image to the existing Almaz service. The
Gitea `verify` workflow only repeats the verification on main.

This app uses Compose service `democracy-now-reference`, container `arkhiv-platform-public-20261004-democracy-now-reference-1`, at
https://democracy-now.subcult.tv/. Deployment uses this repository's dedicated `HOMELAB_DEPLOY_KEY` and
pinned `HOMELAB_KNOWN_HOSTS`. The forced-command receiver is maintained in the
private `subculture-collective/fleet-deploy` repository. Its local profile permits
only this app and frontend service. It refuses stale commits and wrong-app
images, retains the live Compose configuration, verifies image identity,
resources, runtime overrides and public HTML, and restores the previous image
if readiness fails. CI also compares the full public HTML with the image it
built. Private host receipts retain exact prior image IDs and rollback commands.

The homelab operator owns the key; its first rotation deadline is 2027-02-03.
Register and test the receiver/key before merging the pipeline. Keep prior
images, deployment files and receipts for recovery. Raw failure diagnostics stay
in mode-0600 host files and must not be attached to PRs or CI artifacts.

The shared core pins, database, media/archive mounts, public collection review,
original source metadata and engine release procedures retain their own
controls. This pipeline updates the frontend of the already public app; it does
not acquire content or publish additional material. Browser playback/reading,
audiovisual review, independent restore and deployment remain separate evidence.

The public image sets `CORE_UPSTREAM` to `democracy-core:8080` at build time,
using Docker DNS to reach the existing collection-specific API. The default
`api:8080` remains suitable for the isolated local stack. On Almaz the receiver
uses a locally reviewed frontend-only Compose baseline and its registered runtime
guard, so it can deploy without reading sibling services’ private env files.

Before building on main, CI queries the receiver for an already accepted image
for that exact commit. A retry reuses that immutable image and its public HTML
hash, skipping image rebuild/publication. PRs still build and run the nginx
configuration check; the existing verification gate also remains on every run.
